# Autonomous-Robot
Added Code &amp; Apps

This is the repository for the code, applications, and resources regarding the robotics project I am working on.

The project involves creating an autonomous robot that has the ability to navigate around a room and any obstacles it may come across.
The robot also contains a bluetooth module that allows it to send and receive commands and data to and from external sources.
A large part of the project involves creating PC and Android applications that can interface with the robot and allow it to be manually controlled.

The end goal of the robot would be for it to work either autonomously or manually, and to also include a mapping feature that would allow the robot to create maps of its environment.
